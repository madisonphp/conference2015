        <h3>Arriving</h3>
        <p>Directions to the conference are located on our <a href="/venue/">Venue page</a>. When you arrive at <a href="/venue/">the Alliant Energy Center</a>, enter through the Main Entrance for parking. Parking is included with your conference ticket. You will receive the parking access code via email a few days prior to the conference. </p>

        <p>Enter the front doors towards the right side of the building. When you walk in, you will see a registration table with the red Madison PHP logo on the front of it. Check in at this table.</p>

        <h3>Getting Help</h3>

        <p>If you need assistance at any time, any one of <a href="/organizers/">our organizers</a> would be happy to help you out. The organizers will be moving around the venue, but the easiest place to find them will be at the registration table (with the red Madison PHP logo on the front of it).</p>

        <h3>Talks</h3>

        <p>The rooms for the talks will be to the right of the registration area. Each talk room will be clearly labeled on the schedule. If you have any questions about which room a certain talk is in, stop by the registration table</p>

        <p>Our goal is to have the chairs set at tables to make it easy to take notes and/or follow along on a laptop. This may not always be possible, but we will be working to ensure as many chairs have table space as possible.</p>

        <p>The talks will be accompanied by slides, and the speakers will have microphones. If you need any visual or audio assistance, please <a href="http://contact.madisonphpconference.com/">send us an email to let us know what you need</a>. We will do our best to assist you.</p>

        <p>We will have a table labeled "Free Books" where you can find books donated by vendors and other attendees. If you have any old tech-related books that you no longer want, feel free to place them on this table. Looking for a new tech book to read? Stop by and take whatever you'd like.</p>
