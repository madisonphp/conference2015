<h1>What to Expect from Our Conference</h1>

<h2>Arriving</h2>

<p>Directions to the conference are located on our <a href="/venue.html">Venue page</a>. When you arrive at <a href="/venue.html">the Alliant Energy Center</a>, enter through the Main Entrance for parking. Parking is included with your conference ticket. You will receive the parking access code via email a few days prior to the conference. </p>

<p>Enter the front doors towards the right side of the building. When you walk in, you will see a registration table with the red Madison PHP logo on the front of it. Check in at this table.</p>

<h2>Environment</h2>

<p>Madison PHP Conference maintains a welcoming, friendly, polite, and professional environment. Developers of all skill levels are welcome. We have a Code of Conduct that all attendees must agree to when purchasing their ticket. We take all Code of Conduct reports seriously, and our Code of Conduct will be enforced. For more information, please see <a href="conduct.html">the Madison PHP Conference Code of Conduct</a>.</p>

<h2>Getting Help</h2>

<p>If you need assistance at any time, any one of <a href="/views/pages/organizers.html">our organizers</a> would be happy to help you out. The organizers will be moving around the venue, but the easiest place to find them will be at the registration table (with the red Madison PHP logo on the front of it).</p>

<h2>Talks</h2>

<p>The rooms for the talks will be to the right of the registration area. Each talk room will be clearly labeled on the schedule. If you have any questions about which room a certain talk is in, stop by the registration table</p>

<p>Our goal is to have the chairs set at tables to make it easy to take notes and/or follow along on a laptop. This may not always be possible, but we will be working to ensure as many chairs have table space as possible.</p>

<h2>Food</h2>

<p>Lunch will be provided on-site. If you have any dietary restrictions, please let us know when you purchase your ticket or if you have already purchased your ticket, please <a href="http://contact.madisonphpconference.com">send us an email to let us know about your dietary restrictions</a>. Our caterer is happy to work with you on this. We must receive your dietary restrictions at least two weeks prior to the event for our catering requirements. If it is closer than two weeks to the event, we will do our best to accommodate you, but we may not be able to.</p>

<h2>Beverages</h2>

<p>Water will be available at the venue. Additionally, if we get sponsors for them, we may also have coffee, tea, and/or soda available.</p>

<h2>Free Stuff</h2>

<p>We will have a table labeled "Free Swag Table" where vendors have donated stickers, tshirts, and other items. You may take any of the items on this table (except the sign) free of charge. We ask that you please be considerate of others and only take one of each item per person until after lunch. After lunch, you may take as much as you'd like.</p>

<h2>Free Books</h2>

<p>We will have a table labeled "Free Books" where you can find books donated by vendors and other attendees. If you have any old tech-related books that you no longer want, feel free to place them on this table. Looking for a new tech book to read? Stop by and take whatever you'd like.</p>
